Our Game is still in heavy development. The progress currently made allows for a brief amount of play and 
experimentation. However there is no objectives or enemies coded completely.

The options available to the player is movement in a 3d environment. 
the player can also select several weapons, and find a series of pickups in the game world. Each pickup \
changes the gameplay. Accuracy Pickups decrease the spread of the wand. Movement speed increase the player speed 
on both ground and air. Damage boost increase base wand damage.

The environment includes obstacles, like hills bushes and rocks. The player is able to navigate the game world 
using standard wasd controls and mouse looking. The game world is dark, to give a sense of atmosphere, and 
the wand gives of a base amount of light, which allows the player to see in a small radius around them. 

The player has a health bar to keep track of their life. If enemies were functional, they would deal damage 
when close to the player, reducing the life total for each hit. The player can shoot magic using their wand.
Shooting magic drains mana, represented by a blue bar. This bar will slowly refill when not using the wand. 


"Production 2"

Many features have not been implemented. Due to the major changes in the work environment, mainly as 
an effect of the quarantine, the following features are ether incomplete of missing entirely.

Enemies have not been fully finalized. Enemies have a sprites and some movement and characteristics, but are 
built on a pre-existing prefabs. Thus not all functionalities are to the expectations of a fantasy horror game. 

The objective of the game is still unfinished. The four totem like artifacts have not been coded or modeled, 
so there is no current ends state for the game. 


Overall the game is in an unfinished state, due to unforeseen circumstances. Many of the core features and 
aspects have been fully or partially realized.
